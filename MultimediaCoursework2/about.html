    <p>Sir Robert Bryson Hall II (born January 22, 1990), known professionally as Logic,
      is an American YouTuber, streamer, author, retired[4] rapper, singer, songwriter and record producer.
      As a musician, Logic released six studio albums and received two Grammy Award nominations. Logic began his music career in 2010,
      releasing the mixtape Young, Broke & Infamous; he gained popularity with his Young Sinatra mixtape series,
      with the response to its third iteration, Young Sinatra: Welcome to Forever (2013),
      helping Logic secure a recording contract with Def Jam Recordings.
      Logic's first two studio albums — Under Pressure (2014) and The Incredible True Story (2015) —
      both peaked within the top five on the U.S.
      Billboard 200 and were certified gold. Under Pressure subsequently was certified platinum in 2020.
      Logic achieved mainstream popularity in 2017 with Everybody; the album charted at number one in the United States and was certified platinum,
      while its lead single, "1-800-273-8255", reached number three on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and was a top-ten hit internationally.
      He also released the commercial mixtape series Bobby Tarantino. His fourth and fifth albums, YSIV (2018) and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2019),
      achieved similar commercial success, with the latter containing the single "Homicide", which peaked at number five on the Hot 100.

      <p>Logic began a streaming career after releasing his final album, No Pressure, in 2020.
        As an author, Logic released a novel titled Supermarket (2019), which was accompanied by a soundtrack of the same name.
        The book became a New York Times Best Seller, but both works received generally mixed to negative critical reception.
        At the age of 13, Logic met Solomon Taylor, who would soon become his mentor.
        Logic became interested in rap and hip hop after watching the movie Kill Bill: Volume 1, directed by Quentin Tarantino.
        The film's score was produced by RZA, a member of the hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan.
        Following this, Logic began listening to the group, and soon expressed a deep affection for hip hop. Logic bought The Roots' album Do You Want More?!!!??!
        later that year, which prompted Taylor to bring Logic a large number of CDs containing instrumental beats, for him to write lyrics over.
        In 2009, Logic performed under the stage name "Psychological" with Logic describing the name as "one name that really stuck [with me].
        I just loved this word because it was about the mind and I knew that's what I wanted my music to consist of; something that really challenges the mind".
        He released an unofficial mixtape titled Psychological – Logic: The Mixtape under his original stage name.
        The mixtape allowed Logic to serve as the opening act for artists like Pitbull, EPMD, Method Man, Redman,
        and Ludacris at various shows all over Maryland.[citation needed] Soon after, he shortened the "Psychological" moniker to "Logic".

        <p>Following these introductory experiences, Logic released his first official mixtape, Young, Broke & Infamous, on December 15, 2010.
          The mixtape was well received by critics and was the genesis for Logic to establish an early following.
          Chris Zarou, the president of Visionary Music Group, heard the mixtape and signed Logic to the independent label.
          Upon signing, Logic stated in an interview, "Visionary Music Group is like Roc-A-Fella. Damon Dash, that's like Chris Zarou of Visionary Music Group,
          I like to see myself as a Jay. In no way am I arrogant or cocky, I have to see it in order to do it.
          They did it independent and when they signed with a major, they did it the way that they wanted to do it".
          The mixtape was confirmed to have been downloaded over 300,000 times on online mixtape sharing platform DatPiff.
          Logic released his second mixtape, Young Sinatra, in 2011. It serves as the first installment in the Young Sinatra chronology,
          and the mixtape received critical acclaim from various publications, including XXL.
          The music video for "All I Do", released on YouTube, gained over a million views in the week following its release.
          After the success of his previous two projects, Logic released his third mixtape Young Sinatra: Undeniable on April 30, 2012.
          The mixtape is notable for Logic addressing various personal topics, including his future, his father's drug use, his expulsion from school,
          and his mother getting stabbed. Speaking about the mixtape, Logic said,
          "Fans tend to think that if you fall in love with an artist because he makes this kind of sound [but if he gets] bigger and he grows and [his sound changes,
          people also think he changes]. But with me, I created all types of sounds from the get-go, so you can never say I'm changing."
          He commented on the musical aspects of the mixtape, stating, "There's stuff on there for the motherf***ers that don't pay attention to lyrics and just want to have fun,
          but every line is constructed with such depth that the real lyricists and nitpickers have something to listen to."
          After the release of Young Sinatra: Undeniable, Logic completed his first national headlining tour, the Visionary Music Group Tour.
